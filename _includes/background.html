      <a class="underline-link" href="https://ischool.uw.edu/" target="_blank">University of Washington, Seattle</a> where I study Informatics and Applied Mathematics. My academic interests tend to revolve around data, natural language processing and computer vision. I've also previously interned as a Software Developer at

      When I'm not in classes or working, I'm probably <strong>illustrating, learning a new language,
      or crossing off another item on my bucket list.</strong> I'm a certified vocalist, speak 4 languages, and you can check out my art on <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/jadedsouza/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>!
