      I'm a sophomore at the
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://ischool.uw.edu/" target="_blank">University of Washington, Seattle</a>
      where I study Informatics and Data Science. I currently work at 
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/"<strong>T-Mobile</strong></a> as a <p style="color:#8941FF";>Data Analyst Intern</p> 
on their Home Internet Team. I also
      work on
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://ecosystemsentinels.org/" target="_blank">Penguin data</a>
      (yes, Penguins!) through databases and data analysis at a research lab under the University of Washington, Seattle.
       My academic interests tend to revolve around <strong>data,
       natural language processing, software dev. and computer vision.</strong> I've also previously interned as a Software Developer at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.esri.com/en-us/home" target="_blank">ESRI</a>, where I worked
       on image analysis with geographic data.

      When I'm not in classes or working, I'm probably illustrating, learning a new language,
      or crossing off another item on my bucket list. I'm a certified vocalist, speak 4 languages,
       and you can check out my art on <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/jadedsouza/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>!
